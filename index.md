## Let's begin

### where to start

1. Pen and paper at the ready, start with questioning family members for old photos
2. It's very important to get as many birth and death dates as possible, these will help later on when researching
3. Get a folder to store all relevent information and if working on a computer create a working folder on desktop
4. Take your time and cross check information
5. Share your research with other family members who may do the same in return

### Tracing Your Irish Ancestors On The Internet

1. Start from present day and work your way back slowly
2. Dates might not be accurate on some records
3. Spelling mistakes are commonplace on old records
4. Name changes can also prove tiresome
5. Take your time, no rush

### The 1922 fire


Will be discussing the great fire at length of what records were destroyed and what survived.
