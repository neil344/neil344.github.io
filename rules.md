This rule also applies to advertisements through direct messages. 

**3: Do not send friend requests straight after joining.**

**4: Do not use the server as a dating server.**

**5:Conduct conversations in English so that every member can understand.**

**6: Offensive display pictures or nicknames are not allowed, under any circumstance.** 

**7: Do not discuss about sensitive topics**
